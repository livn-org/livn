# STDP Training

This example demonstrates a complete plasticity training loop: a baseline phase without learning, an STDP training phase with periodic synaptic scaling, and a frozen-weight evaluation phase. It produces plots of weight evolution, weight distributions, spike rasters, and per-synapse weight changes.

See [Synaptic Plasticity](../guide/plasticity.md) for background on how the learning rule works.
